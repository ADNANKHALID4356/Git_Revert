    <h2>Git_Revert</h2>
    <p>The git revert command is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit. Unlike git reset, which can alter the commit history, git revert is a safe way to undo changes because it does not remove any commits from the history. Instead, it adds a new commit that reverses the effects of a specified commit.</p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <pre><code>git revert &lt;commit-hash&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Replace &lt;commit-hash&gt; with the hash of the commit you want to revert. This command will open your default text editor to allow you to modify the commit message for the new revert commit.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <pre><code>git revert a1b2c3d4</code></pre>
    <p>This command will create a new commit that undoes the changes made in the commit with the hash a1b2c3d4.</p>
